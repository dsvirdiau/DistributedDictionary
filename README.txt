SERVER :  Source code of server can be compiled and run on JAVA. Which would not need any additional tool.

CLIENT :  Source code of client has to be imported into Android ADT which can be downloaded from the developer.android.com website for free. Pre-requisites for it would be JDK installed previously. Code can be imported and run on Android Emulator or Android Mobile phone directly using the APK file. Please enable "Unknown sources" in settings to install this APK file on your Android Mobile. 


The server currently listens on PORT "7777". Please set the PORT to "7777" in the client application and the IP address according to where the server is running. Also the Server and Client should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network in order to work.
